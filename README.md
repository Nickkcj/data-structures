# **Data Structures and Algorithms 🚀**  

Repository to store and review Data Structures + Algorithms code during my college studies. In addition to consolidating learning, I use this space to practice version control with Git.  

## 📌 **Content**  
Here you will find implementations of various **data structures** and **algorithms**, including:  

### **🛠 Data Structures:**  
✅ Lists (singly linked, doubly linked, circular)  
✅ Stacks and Queues  
✅ Trees (binary, AVL, etc.)  
✅ Graphs  
✅ Hash Tables  

### **⚡ Algorithms:**  
✅ **Sorting Algorithms**: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort  
✅ **Recursion**: Factorial, Fibonacci, Tower of Hanoi, Backtracking problems  
✅ **Searching Algorithms** _(coming soon!)_: Linear Search, Binary Search, Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS)  

## ⚙️ **Technologies Used**  
- Language: *Python*  
- Git/GitHub for version control  

## 🚀 **How to Use**  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nickkcj/data-structures.git
   ```  
2. Navigate to the desired structure or algorithm folder and run the code.  

## 📚 **Objective**  
This repository serves as a space for continuous learning, helping to reinforce concepts and develop good practices in Git usage.
