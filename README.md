# **Data Structures 🚀**

Repository to store and review Data Structures code during my college studies. In addition to consolidating learning, I use this space to practice version control with Git.

## 📌 **Content**  
Here you will find implementations of various structures, including:  
✅ Lists (single, double, circular)  
✅ Stacks and Queues  
✅ Trees (binary, AVL, etc.)  
✅ Graphs  
✅ Hash Tables  

## ⚙️ **Technologies Used**  
- Language: *Python*  
- Git/GitHub for version control  

## 🚀 **How to Use**  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nickkcj/data-structures.git
   ```  
2. Navigate to the desired structure and run the code.

## 📚 **Objective**  
This repository serves as a space for continuous learning, helping to reinforce concepts and develop good practices in Git usage.
